Conceptual Overview
-------------------

Properly configured with respect to baud rate, data bits per character, parity and number of stop bits,
a 115,200 bit per second capable UART provides the input and output timing necessary to implement a 1-Wire master.
The UART produces the 1-Wire reset pulse, as well as read- and write-time slots. The microprocessor simply puts
one-byte character codes into the UART transmit register to send a 1-Wire 1 or 0 bit and the UART does the work.
Conversely, the microprocessor reads single-byte character codes corresponding to a 1 or 0 bit read from a 1-Wire device.
All 1-Wire bit transfers require the bus master, the UART, to begin the cycle by driving the 1-Wire bus low.
Therefore, each 1-Wire bit cycle includes a byte transmit and byte receive by the UART. When reading, the received data
is of interest, when writing, however, the receive byte is discarded. Depending on the UART's read and write first-in,
first-out (FIFO) buffer depth, the UART can also frame 1-Wire bits into byte values further reducing the processor
overhead.
